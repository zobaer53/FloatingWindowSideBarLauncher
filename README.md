# FloatingWindowSideBarLauncher
It contains list of installed apps in an always-on sidebar that launches an app if clicked.
I want to launch an app on split-screen but I found that its not possible. One can only launch activity in another part of the screen if one is already in split-screen mode.(Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37907094/programmatically-open-app-in-split-screen). Feel free to contrebute if you have the solution.
